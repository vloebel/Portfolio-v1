## Additional Notes
   * Photographic placeholders will be used when no external application is available for showcasing. 
   * A combination of five live and dummy sites will be presented.
   * Application should be "mobile-first" - designed to appear best on a small screen with additional CSS to optimize layouts on larger screens.
